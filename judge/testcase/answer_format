There are 3 items in the answer:
[timeout] [operation] [argument]

timeout is a floating point number
there are several possibilities for the operation:
- O: open a pipe
- R: read from stdio
- W: write to a pipe
- D: send a SIGTSTP
- F: make sure a file is deleted


- O argument: [filename to open]
- R argument: [content to expect]
- W argument: [file ID] [content to write]
- D has no argument
- F argument: [filename to check]

The content we feed into R is space-separated, and it supports some special commands:
- *: we don't care what the content is
- ?=: the content is related to the last one using these commands
    - ?: it's different from the last one
    - =: it's the same as the last one
- /: the content should be different from any past contents using the '/' symbol

For example, say the answer is:
0 R * 1
0 R ? 2
0 R ? 3
0 R ? 4
0 R / 5
0 R / 6
0 R / 7
0 R = 8
0 R * 9
0 R ? 10

This is a correct output:
blah 1
abc 2
def 3
abc 4
abc 5
def 6
ghi 7
abc 8
abcd 9
def 10

Here are some incorrect outputs:
- Change 'blah 1' to 'blah 2'. It receives WA because '1' is not equal to '2'.
- Change 'def 3' to 'abc 3'. It receives WA because the 'abc' part is the same as the last line.
- Change 'ghi 7' to 'abc 7'. It receives WA because the 'abc' part has occured in 'abc 5'.
- Change 'abc 8' to 'def 8'. It receives WA because the first part has to be the same as 'abc 4'
- Change 'def 10' to 'abc 10'. It receives WA because 'abc' is the same as the 'abc 8'.

the file ID in w is the order of the file being created
for example, if we open 'a' first then 'b', the file ID of a is 0, and the file ID of b is 1
